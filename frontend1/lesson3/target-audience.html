            <ul>

                    <h3>1) Jeff</h3>
                    <p>
                        Jeff is a college student who lives in Preston Idaho.
                        With all of his classes being switched to zoom, he doesn't get
                        out much. He decided that he was gonna spend more time 
                        outside on days that are nice and sunny!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>2) Sally</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sally loves the Napolean Dynamite movie! She has always 
                        dreamed of taking a couple of days off so she can take a 
                        vacation to visit Napolean's ol' stomping grounds in Preston
                        Idaho. Being from Texas, she has never been to Preston and
                        has no clue what the weather will be like! What should she 
                        pack??
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><p>
                    <strong>Scenario 1:</strong> Jeff woke up an hour before class! Normally he rolls
                    out of bed 15 minutes before hand, so this was an early
                    start for him. He was excited to get outside at some point during
                    the day but had no clue what the weather was going to be like. 
                    He grabbed his phone so he could check.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    <strong>Scenario 2:</strong> Sally is trying to figure out what
                    she needs to pack for a successful 3 day trip to Preston Idaho!
                    Since she is flying, she only has a limited amount of space in 
                    her suitcase. She grabs her phone to see if she can get some
                    more info.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    <strong>Scenario 3:</strong> Jeff is running late for a party
                    at his best friend's house. He looks out the window and sees
                    that it is pretty cloudy! He wonders if he should grab a jacket
                    just in case.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    <strong>Scenario 4:</strong> Sally finally gets to Preston 
                    and to her surprise, it was snowing! She had only packed a 
                    light jacket because the forecast didn't say it would snow!
                    Wanting to make the most of her trip and see the sites, she
                    wondered how long the snow would last.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    <strong>Scenario 5:</strong> Jeff was trying to plan a day
                    to go mountain biking with his friends. He had finally nailed
                    down a time that worked for everyone, but then he realized
                    that he hadn't checked the weather yet. He grabbed his phone,
                    crossing his fingers that it would be a nice day!
