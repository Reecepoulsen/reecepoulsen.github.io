            We all have moments in life when we wish to share our feelings with 
            someone else in a way that goes deeper than words. Some turn to poetry, 
            others turn to art, and the rest of us turn to music. Music is meant 
            to be shared, and when it is, connections happen. Imagine a place where 
            you can share the music that tells your story. Chords aims to make that 
            place a reality. My vision is to create a platform in which you can connect 
            with your favorite people through the chords of your favorite music.

          <p id="home-p2">
            Chords is a social media platform designed around celebrating the art of 
            music and its ability to bring people together. Similar to other social media 
            platforms, each person will have a profile to represent themself and their taste 
            in music. Chords isn't meant to replace your favorite music streaming app, in 
            fact, it is designed to work hand in hand with the streaming app of your choice. 
            Once connected, all of your playlists will be automatically imported to your 
            Chords account and then you can start building your profile.

            Obviously, this idea is way too big for a student in their first web development class, 
            but when I stumbled upon it, I realized that its never been done before! Music and 
            programming are two of my passions, so I figured that I would turn this assignment into 
            something that I could be passionate about. The purpose of this website is to help you 
            catch the vision. The other two associated pages demonstrate what a profile could look 
            like and some of the features I would like to see included in the application. There is
            also an example of a login page.
