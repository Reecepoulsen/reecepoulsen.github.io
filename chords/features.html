            <h3>Friends</h3>
            <p>
                This feature would be a mix between a feed and a messaging system. 
                This is where you would interact with your friends, share new songs 
                that you found, and visit friend's pages to see their favorites.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Genres</h3>
            <p>
                This feature will automatically organize your music into genres. 
                I've always found it difficult to relate to a genre because I have 
                no idea what genres the artists I listen to are a part of, this 
                section should solve that problem.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Discover</h3>
            <p>
                Similar to Spotify, I want to include a way for those looking for 
                new music to discover their next favorites. This section would include 
                something similar to Spotify's discover weekly. I would also add 2 other 
                features, the first would suggest new songs based off of the genres you 
                listen to the most and the second would recommend new music based off of 
                what your friends are listening to.

              <h3>Activites</h3>
              <p>
                We all have music that we listen to specifically when we are working out, 
                doing homework, relaxing, riding in the car, and just about anything else 
                you can think of. The idea behind an activity is similar to a hashtag, it 
                would be a way of connecting a song to an activity. Then you could browse 
                through the activity top charts and see what other people listen to.

              <h3>Lyrics</h3>
              <p>
                I love learning the lyrics behind songs but I don't like having to hop onto 
                google to look them up. Chords will have an in-app capability to display lyrics.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Behind The Scenes</h3>
              <p>
                I feel like every song has a story to tell but sometimes it can be hard to 
                tell what that story is. This feature would allow you to look up the 
                "behind the scenes" information for each song so you can finally figure out 
                why your favorite song was written.
