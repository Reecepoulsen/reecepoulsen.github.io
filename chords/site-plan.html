      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>	We love our music! The average person spends about 2.6 hours a day listening to music, that’s a whole 18 hours a week! 
        But, if you're like me, your playlist can start to feel stale and repetitive with all that listening. If only there was 
        a way to discover new music more frequently. That’s where my app, Chords, comes in. Chords is a social media platform 
        based on the idea of sharing the music that you listen to with your friends. Chords combines two modern ideas: Social 
        Media and music streaming to build a profile that can help you discover the music your friends listen to and suggest new 
        music you might like. 
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My target audiences for this website are those who love listening to and discovering new music. Social media has become
        infused into each of our lives and Chords aims to create a link between our love for being connected with others and our love
        for listening to music. This website hopes to fill the niche for music lovers that instagram fills for picture lovers.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <p>
        I picked this font because it matches my logo and its very simple. When I look at 
        other platforms like Spotify and Facebook, they use very simple fonts as well. I want the
        interface to feel clean, modern, and stylish and I think this font brings that in  <!-- change this -->

      <h4>Chords That Bind</h4>
      <p>
        We all have moments in life when we wish to share our 
        emotions with someone else in a way that goes deeper than words.
        Some turn to poetry, others turn to art, and the rest of us turn to music.
        Music is meant to be shared, and when it is, connections happen. 
        Imagine a place where you can share the music that tells your story.
        Chords aims to make that place a reality. My vision is to create a platform
        in which you can connect with your favorite people through the chords of your favorite music.
      </p>

      <h4>The Vision</h4>
      <p>
        Chords is a social media platform designed around celebrating the art of music 
        and its ability to bring people together. Similar to other social media platforms,
        each person will have a profile to represent themself and their taste in music.
        Chords isn't meant to replace your favorite music streaming app, in fact, it is
        designed to work hand in hand with the streaming app of your choice. Once 
        connected, all of your playlists will be automatically imported to your Chords account and
        then you can start building your profile. 
      </p>

      <h4>What to Expect</h4>
      <p>
        Obviously, this idea is way too big for a student in their first web development class,
        but when I stumbled upon it, I realized that its never been done before! Music
        and programming are two of my passions, so I figured that I would turn this assignment
        into something that I could be passionate about. The purpose of this website is to 
        help you catch the vision. The other two associated pages demonstrate what a profile 
        could look like and some of the features I would like to see included in the application. 
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
      <ul>
        <li><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/f4a3b7ce-9e91-4f32-b9b3-4ea09aa0309f%2Fblack_and_white_headphones.jpg?v=1604207449240" width="400" alt="image for homepage"></li>
        <li><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/f4a3b7ce-9e91-4f32-b9b3-4ea09aa0309f%2Fcolor_concert.jpg?v=1604207455086" width="400" alt="image for homepage"></li>

      </ul>X
      
      <h3>My Profile</h3>
      <p>
        A profile would include a heading that would have a profile picture and 
        a banner image behind the profile picture. Underneath that, there would be
        a nav bar to toggle between different pages. The body of the profile would
        contain a couple of widgets. The first would be a section to display your
        top 3 artist picks and your top 5 songs from each artist. The second would 
        include your top 25 songs. And the third would be your 10 most recently
        added songs.
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Page 2</p>
      <ul>
        <li><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/f4a3b7ce-9e91-4f32-b9b3-4ea09aa0309f%2Fprofile%20pic.png?v=1604207510426" width="400" alt="image for page"></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Features</h3>
      <p>
        This section contains a list of features and their descriptions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Friends</h4>
          <p>
            This feature would be a mix between a feed and a messaging system. This is where
            you would interact with your friends, share new songs that you found, and visit 
            friend's pages to see their favorites.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Genres</h4>
          <p>
            This feature will automatically organize your music into genres. I've always 
            found it difficult to relate to a genre because I have no idea what genres the 
            artists I listen to are a part of, this section should solve that problem.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Discover</h4>
          <p>
            Similar to Spotify, I want to include a way for those looking for new music to 
            discover their next favorites. This section would include something similar to 
            Spotify's discover weekly. I would also add 2 other features, the first would 
            suggest new songs based off of the genres you listen to the most and the second 
            would recommend new music based off of what your friends are listening to.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Activites</h4>
          <p>
            We all have music that we listen to specifically when we are working out, doing 
            homework, relaxing, riding in the car, and just about anything else you can think 
            of. The idea behind an activity is similar to a hashtag, it would be a way of 
            connecting a song to an activity. Then you could browse through the activity top 
            charts and see what other people listen to. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Lyrics</h4>
          <p>
            I love learning the lyrics behind songs but I don't like having to hop onto google 
            to look them up. Chords will have an in-app capability to display lyrics.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Behind The Scenes</h4>
          <p>
            I feel like every song has a story to tell but sometimes it can be hard to tell
            what that story is. This feature would allow you to look up the "behind the scenes"
            information for each song so you can finally figure out why your favorite song was 
            written. 
          </p>
