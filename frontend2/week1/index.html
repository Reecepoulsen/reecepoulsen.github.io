                        Always design mobile first! It helps you narrow down on what content is most important
                        for your site
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provide users with what they want to see as soon as possible
                    </li>

                        Ways to improve loading times: reduce image usage, use svg or webfonts, optimize and minify
                        css and js files, and gzip your files.
                    </li>

                        Keep important buttons within reach for your user. Will give the appearance of a faster site
                        because they won't have to reach as far to interact.
